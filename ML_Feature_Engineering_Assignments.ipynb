        " -In machine learning, a parameter is a variable that the model learns from the training data. These values determine how the model makes predictions.\n",

        " -Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that enables computers to learn patterns from data and make decisions or predictions without being explicitly programmed. Main components are: Data, fetaure, model algorithms, testing, evolution and deployment for real world predictions.\n",
